# Gamepad-Gaussians

GAMEPAD GAUSSIANS is a series of images created by integrating random integers from a Gaussian distribution into the plotting coordinates of a drawing algorithm in the Processing programming language.  The distribution of ellipse centers is concentrated in the middle of the canvas and becomes dispersed towards the outer edges of the horizontal and vertical axes.  The algorithm uses a PS4-style gamepad to control parameters such as color, transparency, size, and dispersion.
