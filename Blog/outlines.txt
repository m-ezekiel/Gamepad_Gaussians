1. Gamepad Gaussians

Gamepad Gaussians is an art video game that integrates random integers from a Gaussian distribution into the plotting coordinates of a drawing algorithm. The algorithm uses a PS4-style gamepad to control parameters such as color, transparency, size, and dispersion.


2. Player Experience

The game is completely devoid of narrative, competition, scoring and there are no explicit goals.  So what are you supposed to do?  Play in easy mode to see what the game is capable of and then move onto hard mode to execute purposeful aesthetic decisions (and combine them inbetween).

I'll readily admit that it's difficult for me as the designer to 


3. Gameplay Controls

The controls are divided between drawing parameters and value modifiers.  The preview window gives a visual representation of numerical position of the paramaters relative to their range.


4. Additive Color Theory

It's not the same as mixing pigment.  RGB lives in 255 and such is how we get the classic 16 million unique colors on a digital monitor.


5. Experimental Design

The nature of the game is such that you can manipulate drawing variables with a very fine degree of control.
