I want to know about vountary engagement levels and self-reported gameplay impressions.
The data will show how many new sessions were initiated and the quantity of data inside
each one.  For sessions of a certain length I could also do a cluster analysis to look
at keypress colocation.  

DOCUMENTATION:
- Controller keymap
- Github tutorial page
- Video tutorial

It's interesting that some players have described an approach I hadn't anticipated in 
gameplay: play a little, do something else, repeat over the course of an undefined amount
of time.  The difference in that case was the enormous size of the screen.  I should get
the data from that session.
